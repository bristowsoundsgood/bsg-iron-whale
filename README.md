## Introduction
This is my first attempt at creating a fully-functional audio FX plugin: a delay/echo effect with added harmonic excitement capabilities. This involves learning the relevant mathematics behind non-linear digital signal processing (DSP). All of this is self-taught. 

I am documenting the entire development process through commits. Mostly for personal enjoyment and learning.

## Intentions
* Delay DSP algorithm.
* Saturation / Excitation / Distortion DSP algorithms.
* VST3 & AU plugin format support.
* Slick GUI.
